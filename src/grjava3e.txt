===========================================================

After expanding the file grjava2e.zip, you will obtain a set of .java files, which are
not all complete programs. You can compile and run the following programs; they are all
applications, not applets, and they may require other files, also present in this set.
Here is a list of these program files, each with a reference to the corresponding section in the book.
For example, program Bspline.java, listed below, is discussed in Section 4.7. To see this program 
in action, use a command window and enter the following two commands:

javac Bspline.java
java Bspline

Besides program files, there is also the input file letterA.dat, so you can immediately test the 
four 3D programs Wireframe.java, HLines.java, Painter.java, and ZBuf.java.
